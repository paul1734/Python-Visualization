# Python Visualization

This is used to demonstrate some different visualizations using open accessible data.

The smoking project is based on smoking data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/us-smoking-trend) and the added GDP per capita data is from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD).

The main data cleaning is done in the correspondingly named data_cleaning.py file. Seaborn plots are done in Seaborn_Intro.py and the plotly code is within plotly_slider.py.
